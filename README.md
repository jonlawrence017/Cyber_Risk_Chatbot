# Cybersecurity Chatbot Repository

**Work in Progress**

This repository is actively under development to build a cybersecurity chatbot that assesses risks and provides mitigation strategies based on user inputs and a threat database.

## Goals
- Develop a robust chatbot using NLP models (e.g., DistilBERT) to identify cyber vulnerabilities.
- Maintain and expand a SQLite database (`cyber_threats.db`) with threat data.
- Provide actionable risk assessments and mitigation advice.
- Enable easy analysis of threat data through scripts (e.g., `analyze_cyber_threats.py`).
- Integrate LangChain for agentic workflows to generate concise responses.

Stay tuned for updates as we enhance functionality and add features!
